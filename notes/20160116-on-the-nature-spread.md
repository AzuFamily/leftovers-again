I was playing around with natures and trying to figure out the percentage shift caused by these natures...

(chance) description: (multiplier)
(4/25*4/25) Bad nature for attacks and good nature for defenses: (10/11)(10/11)
(4/25*17/25) Bad nature for attacks, neutral nature for defenses: (10/11)
(17/25*4/25) Neutral nature for attacks, good nature for defenses: (10/11)
(17/25*17/25) Neutral nature for attacks, neutral nature for defenses: 1
(4/25*17/25) Good nature for attacks, neutral nature for defenses: (11/10)
(17/25*4/25) Neutral nature for attacks, bad nature for defenses: (11/10)
(4/25*4/25) Good nature for attacks, bad nature for defenses: (11/10)

OR

(0.0256) Bad nature for attacks and good nature for defenses: .8264
(0.2176) Bad nature for attacks xor good nature for defenses: .9091
(0.4624) Neutral nature for attacks, neutral nature for defenses: 1
(0.2176) Good nature for attacks xor bad nature for defenses: 1.1
(0.0256) Good nature for attacks, bad nature for defenses: 1.21
