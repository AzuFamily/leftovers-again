OK, you're all set! Your core bot files are in the current directory.

Before you begin, install your dependencies:
`npm install`

Your bot's already prepared for battle! First, open a new window and run the server locally:
    git clone https://github.com/dramamine/Pokemon-Showdown.git
    cd Pokemon-Showdown
    npm start

Run this command to play against your first opponent:

`npm start -- --opponent=randumb`

Other useful commands:
`npm run start:quick`: run with babel-node (skips transpiling step)
`npm start -- --production`: connect to metal-heart.org.psim.us
`npm start -- --help`: full list of commands for leftovers-again
