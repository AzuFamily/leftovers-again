OK, you're all set! Your core bot files are in the current directory.

Your bot's already prepared for battle! First, open a new window and run the official server locally:
    git clone https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown.git
    cd Pokemon-Showdown
    npm start

Run this command to play against your first opponent:
`npm start -- --opponent=randumb`
