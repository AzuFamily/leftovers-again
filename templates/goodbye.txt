OK, you're all set! Your core bot files are in this folder:
bots/{{repo}}

Your bot's already prepared for battle! First, get a local server running:
`npm run server`

Then, in a new window, run this command to play against your first opponent:
`npm run develop -- --bot={{repo}} --opponent=randumb --loglevel=2`

Ready for more and tougher opponents? Run this command to choose your opponents:
`npm run gauntlet`

Want to make sure your bot won't break under pressure? Run tests against it:
`cd bots/{{repo}} && npm test`
